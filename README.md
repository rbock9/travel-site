## Introduction

This website is the end result of a Udemy course I took called _"Git a Web Developer Job: Mastering the Modern Workflow"_. It's a pretty simple single-page website for a fake travel company, and it was created with a lot of the popular skills, modern tools, and overall best-practices that companies are looking for in web developers. But what exactly did I learn? Read more below! 


## Site Features

- Animated sticky header follows users on page scroll; page section header links become highlighted when corresponding page section scrolls into view.

- Several buttons on the page ("Get in Touch", "Get Started Today") launch a JavaScript-powered modal popup on click.

- Fully responsive page layout created with various mobile-first CSS techniques paired with animations to create modern, interactive user experience.

- BONUS #1: At the bottom of the page is a React-generated section (named "This is My Super Cool React Component").

- BONUS #2: Below the React-generated section is another section (named "Secret Client Area") included via a basic cloud function running on Netlify. (The password is "javascript").


## Technologies I Used
- Visual Studio Code text editor
- Git, GitHub, and the command-line
- Node.js & associated tools like NPM, Babel and webpack
- Mobile-first CSS with SCSS/SASS, BEM & PostCSS, techniques like CSS Grid & Flexbox
- Object-oriented JavaScript; ES6 module pattern
- React (basically just for demonstration purposes)
- Netlify & GitHub Pages for deployment, Netlify for basic cloud (AWS Lambda) functions

## Skills I Used

- Practiced Git, GitHub, and command-line basics for the purposes of collaboration with other developers and deployment of sites live up onto the web.

- Leveraged Node.js tools like NPM and webpack to save time by automating tasks.

- Enhanced CSS knowledge with techniques (BEM & PostCSS) to keep styles super-organized and manageable even on larger sites.

- Sped up website with the mobile-first performance philosophy.

- Practiced JavaScript basics like Object-oriented Programming, and how to write well-structured code using the ES6 module pattern (Babel & webpack).

- Used the Netlify service to not only host website but also learned the basics of cloud (or AWS Lambda) functions.


## Conclusion
While I already have a web developer job, and I was at least somewhat familiar with everything covered here thanks to the full-stack software engineering boot camp I completed two years ago, I'm glad I took the time to work through this course. I think the instructor has a knack for explaining things in a way that fills in whatever knowledge gaps I seem to have, and I'm now much more comfortable with — and likely to use — every topic covered here. 

Devoting time to learning every day is crucial for anyone looking to 'git' and keep a career in web development, so I'd recommend working through this course if you're like me and looking for ways to continue honing your web dev skills.
